It is hard to see whether or not I'm improving over the course of my life time.

If the process is stagnant, one loses confidence and motivation. If the achievement is too small, improving may just become redundant and chore.

Thus I am creating an Annal for myself, to record every improvement that I made on a weekly basis. The topic can be anything, as long as it is overall + compared to before. If I cannot write one that week, that means my week was poor.

Hopefully, this will be a motivation for me to keep finding a way to improve myself. Over time, I wish that these annals lead me to somewhere better than before :)
