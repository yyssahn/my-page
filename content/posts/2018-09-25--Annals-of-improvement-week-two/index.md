This week, the self improvement was not that significant. But there are some measures that I have taken to start the train.

I've played around how material design works, and the "philosophy" behind it. Honestly, I have felt that it was too mobiley at first, but I think I understand the benefits

I've started learning about machine learning, specifically TensorFlow. I'm scheduled to give high level talk about it very soon, so I need to be prepared soon.

For my mental health, I have started mindfulness meditation. I do not have a good way to vent out my stress and frustration out (like exercise); hopefully this will help my mental health in the long run. But the plan is to start exercising soon so that the mental and physical health is maintained
