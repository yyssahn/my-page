DevFest Season is coming, and GDG organizers are getting busy.

We have some really interesting speakers and topics for this year's DevFest that we are getting too much excited already, I just hope that people show up D:

But the content is really going to be awesome. Lots of Machine Learning, Android, GCP, G Suite etc etc.

Also talking to all these smart people inspired me a lot, and made me think of myself. Why am I not smart as them to be giving talks, thus setting a goal to be a GDE one day :).
